# Patreon Theater Mode

A browser extension that moves the video content of post pages to a better, much larger, spot. Also, uses dark mode

## How to use

Currently, it's not an official extension that is available in the chrome extensions web store, but it can be used until I decide to put it there.

1. Download this repo (use the zip if you don't know how to use git/github, then extract)
